# Spatial Mouse Concept

## Overview

The Spatial Mouse is an innovative input device that combines the functionality of a traditional computer mouse with a VR controller. This unique combination allows for seamless transitions between 2D and 3D interactions in virtual environments.

## Key Features

- Functions as a standard 2D mouse on flat surfaces
- Transforms into a 3D VR controller when lifted
- Seamless transition between 2D and 3D interactions
- Compatible with both traditional desktop applications and VR environments

## Use Cases

### 1. 3D Design and Modeling

Ideal for designers working on 3D objects in virtual environments:
- Use as a regular mouse for 2D design software
- Lift to manipulate 3D objects (grab, drag, rotate) without switching devices
- Eliminates the need to remove VR headset to locate separate controllers

### 2. Virtual Workspaces

Perfect for professionals working in mobile or space-constrained environments:
- Operate normally for standard computer tasks
- Easily control virtual monitors and windows in a VR workspace
- Adjust virtual surroundings without additional equipment

## Benefits

- Increased productivity by reducing device switching
- Enhanced workflow in mixed 2D/3D environments
- Improved portability for VR-enhanced work setups
