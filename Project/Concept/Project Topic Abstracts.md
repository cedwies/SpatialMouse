## Preference 1

**Spatial Mouse:**

The spatial mouse could be a clever connection between a computer mouse and a VR controller. 

There are some useful use cases for this product. 
A good example could be a designer, who designs 3D objects on a virtual monitor. The designer can use the spatial mouse for his normal 2D design program but also lift it up and grab, drag and rotate the virtual object the designer is working on, without the need of taking off the VR glasses and looking for VR controller. 

Another, simpler use case could be someone working not at a the office with multiple monitors but in a caf√© where you dont have external monitors. A virtual monitor setup would be nice. In this case this person could use the spatial mouse to perform the normal computer work but also control VR things like dragging screens and windows to another place or changing something in the virtual surrounding.

## Preference 2

**Smart AsS:**

In today's sedentary lifestyle, maintaining a good seating posture is crucial for overall health. Unfortunately, due to laziness and unawareness, we tend not to pay enough attention to our posture.

To address this issue, we would like to design a chair which will serve as a personal posture coach, providing gentle reminders to sit up straight when needed, or get off the chair completely.

This can be achieved by utilising weight and pressure sensors within the seat, so that the chair will detect changes in posture and gives real-time feedback to the user. Additionally, the chair will be programmed to recognise and save potential profiles for individual users, including key attributes including (but not limited to) height, weight, gender and body proportion.

The prototype will cater to a wide range of users such as office workers, gamers, students and people with sedentary jobs. By integrating the physical computing principles, the project will be a tangible and interactive device that responds to user input and environmental stimulus.
