We couldn't upload the entire Unity project here, so we've included only the scripts we developed. It's worth noting that Robin had already worked on some of these scripts prior to this course. Since we simulated our own VR controller, we couldn't use many of the pre-existing scripts and had to rewrite most parts. However, we were able to utilize the already implemented functionality for the virtual mouse cursor.
