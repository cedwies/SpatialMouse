## Topic - Spatial Mouse:

The spatial mouse is a clever connection between a computer mouse and a VR controller. 

There are some useful use cases for this product. 
A good example could be a designer, who designs 3D objects on a virtual monitor. The designer can use the spatial mouse for his normal 2D design program but also lift it up and grab, drag and rotate the virtual object the designer is working on, without the need of taking off the VR glasses and looking for VR controller. 

Another, simpler use case could be someone working not at a the office with multiple monitors but in a caf√©, where you dont have any external monitors. A virtual monitor setup would be nice. In this case this person could use the spatial mouse to perform the normal computer work but also control VR things like dragging screens and windows to another place or changing something in the virtual surrounding.
