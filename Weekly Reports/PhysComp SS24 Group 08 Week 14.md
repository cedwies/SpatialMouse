# PhysComp SS24 Assignment - Week 14

> **Deadline:** 01.08.2024, 23:59 CEST

To wrap up this course, we're giving you *one final assignment*, in which you hand in any remaining materials.

## Final Submission


Our prototype is a Spatial Mouse, which is a combination of a traditional computer mouse and a VR controller. It shall enable the user to have both functionalities without needing to switch between two separate devices.

### What works: 
- Mouse functionality (Motion sensor, buttons for left and right click, tactile switch for scrolling)
- VR functionality
- On/Off switch

### Limitations:
- Motion sensor has a short delay

### Future improvements:

- Remove the motion sensor delay
- Replace buttons for improved feedback
- Consider replacing the Scroll Switch with a scroll wheel or a small joystick to allow gradual instead of constant scrolling
- Incorporate methods to reduce power consumption (deep sleep of the arduino, ...)
- Add modal (auditive) feedback
- Conduct more user studies to find better sizes for having improved universal fit for various hand sizes


2. In this post, include a **video of your final prototype in action** (e.g., the one from your slides). This is what will survive, even after your prototypes are take apart.

    You should aim for *~2 minutes* and add a *title screen* with your (1) project name, (2) your group number, and (3) your names of course.




3. Ensure that all your **source code, design files, etc.** are in your GitLab repository. Please **add a README.md** file in the subfolder with your project code, **listing libraries/tutorials/code sources** that you used (including links). In particular, please point out files wherein the code was **not** implemented by you. Also, please describe **how to build and run** your code.
