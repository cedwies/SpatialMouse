# PhysComp SS24 Assignment - Week 6

> **Deadline:** 04.06.2024, 23:59 CEST

## Weekly Progress Report
1.	**3D Printing:** Post *screenshots* of your 3D model(s) and briefly describe what you did, or whether you struggled with something. Upload your final *3D your models*, so we can print all next week. (Once it's done, please add a *photo* of the resulting print to document the outcome of your first 3D printing exercise.)

We both had a very similar approach regarding the design of our mug. We started by creating a cylinder and used the "Shell" command to create a hollow cavity within that cylinder. Next, we used the drill feature to create a hole at the bottom. We then continued to create a 2D sketch for the handle, which we then extraploated. After combining the two components, we extensively used "Fillet" command to smooth out the edges. 

A major difficulty was that we needed some time to figure out how to combine the two components (cylinder and handle) together. Furthermore, we found the navigation of "Autodesk Fusion" to be complicated and confusing. However, we already argued that over time, one has the possibility to become much more efficient in designing even more complicated 3D models.

2.	**Progress Report:** What have you achieved this week with regards to your project? As usual, if your *concept* has changed, briefly describe this (and post pictures). Also, report on your progress in *developing your prototype* or *acquiring equipment*.

We were able to familiarize ourselves with designing 3D models, which can then be printed by 3D printers. We are confident, that we are now able to design the prototype of our spatial mouse properly. Additionally, we ordered the core component of the spatial mouse (mouse sensor) which need a substantial amount of delivery time (shipped from Canada). We were not able to completely agree on other components such as mouse wheel and buttons. However, we do not think that this is a big problem, since these components are available in stores which ship from Germany, therefore having a significantly shorter delivery time.

Regarding the development of our prototype, we were successful on deciding our final design choice, which was a great relief, since it now allows to proceed on our project by taking the next steps into the right directions.


## Project Plan for Prototype Development
It’s half time! Now it’s important to reflect and budget your remaining resources.

3.	Specify at least **4 milestones** for your prototype development (from now until the end of this course). Briefly describe what needs to be achieved for each. 

**Milestone 1: Decide on a Design**

Our first milestone is to finalize the design concept for our spatial mouse. We need to review all the different design ideas we've discussed over the past few weeks. The design we choose will become the prototype we aim to build. We will think through this design in detail, planning where each button will be placed, how the battery will be integrated, and how the cables will connect to each component. This detailed planning will help ensure that our prototype is both functional and user-friendly.

**Milestone 2: Test Functionality**

For our second milestone, we need to ensure that our first prototype functions as intended. We will assemble the components and test the prototype to see if it meets our desired functionality. This stage is crucial because it allows us to identify and fix any issues with the components or their assembly before moving on to the next step.

**Milestone 3: Build the Components into a Prototype**

In this milestone, we aim to find a shape for the spatial mouse that accommodates all the components. We will assemble everything into a body and test its usability. This step helps us identify any improvements needed in the design. By using this prototype, we can make adjustments and refinements to enhance the overall design and functionality.

**Milestone 4: 3D Print the Spatial Mouse**

Our final milestone is to 3D print the refined design from Milestone 3. After printing the final shape, we will assemble all the components into and onto the 3D printed body. Our goal is to have a fully functional spatial mouse prototype that works as intended. This step will bring together all our efforts and allow us to see the final product in action.


Unfortunately, our product does not allow for any functionality to be faked, since the a proper demonstration requires both the computer mouse and the VR controller to work correctly. Only then will users be able to fully evaluate our final prototype.
