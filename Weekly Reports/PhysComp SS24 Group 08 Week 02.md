# PhysComp SS24 Group 8 - Week 1

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week


This week, our task was to work with Arduino and learn how simple electric circuits work. Since we both don't have any experience with hardware and micro controllers, it was new and interesting. We started with the basic tutorials on the Arduino page. After learning the basics of how a simple electric circuit is built and what different components have what functionality, we started to build our own few circuits (see pictures). At the end of this session, we came to the section where we had to run a test program on an Arduino micro controller, where the LED on the controller started to blink. After achieving this, the session was over.

### What we could not achieve this week

Unfortunately, we were unable to completely finish the course. We needed some time to actually figure out how all individual components work together. One mayor reasons for this was that we needed a substantial amount of time to get things up and running, especially finding the correct online course took us some time. 

However, the main problem was that we frequently got caught up in playing around with the components. We did not follow the course strictly, but rather started to experiment a lot at certain times. While we believe this to be a good way of learning, for the next time we would try to adhere to the course a little bit more strictly.


### What we plan to do for the coming week


We would like to continue to familiarise ourselves with the hardware, especially by experimenting with the Arduino micro controller. Up to this point we only worked with non-programmable electric circuits. We are excited to bridge the gap between programming and hardware, in order to maximise our expertise for the upcoming weeks and primarily the final prototype.
